# CeosBot_Repo
Repository of my chatbot development for the computer engineering course at the Federal University of Par√°

Contains the files used to run a chatbot based on python using the rasa framework version 3.5.

In case of using it's needed to train the model, given that github doesn't accepted the model trained because of it's size.
